        <h1>‘Direct Subsidy Scheme’ (DSS) School Receiving Government Subsidy<bold>*</bold>
        </h1>
        <section>
            In September 1999, our school joined ‘Direct Subsidy Scheme’ officially and became a fully
            government-subsidized secondary school.
            ‘Direct Subsidy Scheme’ is characterized in two perspectives. Firstly, the government subsidizes schools
            with public funds. Secondly,
            schools are given greater autonomy in the areas of finance, curriculum and students admission. It has been
            commented by some scholars
            that ‘directly-subsidized school is an advanced step in school-based management’ and it allows more
            flexibility in the management.
            This new system empowers us to facilitate autonomy and accountability; motivate us to implement various
            measures for enhancement and
            provides parents with a wider scope and better quality of education services. Therefore, it has been said
            that, ‘A new hope of the government
            in the area of educational reform lies on directly-subsidized schools’.
