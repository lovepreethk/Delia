            <h1>Delia Broadway </h1>
            <p>We believe that students’ learning should not be limited by the four walls of the classroom. Therefore,
                students are encouraged to join different activities
                to enhance their learning experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                With the full support from the parents, 13 Broadway students flew to Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia on 1
                October 2012 to participate in the U17
                Cricket International Invitation Challenge 2012. The competitors came from Australia, New Zealand,
                Malaysia,
                Pakistan and India. As a secondary school team, we eventually placed 2nd Runner-Up in the tournament.
                <br />
                <br />
                A good result in an overseas tournament earned much respect from other opponents, but the most
                commendable achievement should be the
                excellent impressions they instilled in the minds of the organizers and team managers. Our students
                demonstrated outstanding team spirit in Malaysia.
                <br />
                <br />
                For the past few years, we have launched a series of programmes aimed at the students’ personal growth
                and we have also worked closely
                together with parents to nurture Broadwayers’ character and all-round development of our students.

            <p>Since its establishment, Delia Hip Wo has been providing educational services to local ethnic groups. In
                recent years, in order
                to meet the needs of the society, it has admitted lots of students from the newly-immigrated families
                from the mainland.
                At present, Delia Hip Wo has become a specialized school in offering education service both to the
                ethnicity minority
                students and the newly-arrival students in Hong Kong.
                <br /><br />
                We are committed to developing Delia Hip Wo as a place for ‘Balanced development of five virtues,
                Integration of multiple
                cultures and Success opportunities and actualization’.Our aim is to nurture students’ generic skills,
                knowledge, values and attitudes as well
                as enable them to receive an all-rounded development of five virtues: ethics, intellect, physical
                development, social skills and aesthetics.
                <br /><br />
                Create opportunity of success: Everyone has a chance for success. We strongly believe that education
                should lead one to the
                path of success rather than failure. Hence, we endeavor to establish a campus that is full of success
                opportunities so that
                everyone will work hard to attain success.
